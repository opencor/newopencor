There are two `XSL <https://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/>`__ files for converting `Content MathML <https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/chapter4.html>`__ to `Presentation MathML <https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter2.html>`__: |ctop.xsl|_ and |ctopff.xsl|_. The difference between the two is that |ctopff.xsl|_ uses a modified namespace and mode usage. Those differences are necessary if we want to use the `XSL <https://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/>`__ file with `Firefox <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>`__ (hence the file name!) and, as it happens, they are also necessary for use with `Qt <https://www.qt.io/>`__ and `QtWebKit <https://wiki.qt.io/QtWebKit>`__ in particular. This is therefore the version we use here. However, the `Presentation MathML <https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter2.html>`__ it generates is not exactly what we want, so we edited the file quite a bit.
