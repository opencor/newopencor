We build our own copy of `libSEDML <https://github.com/fbergmann/libSEDML/>`__, which requires the following:

- `libSEDML's source code <https://github.com/fbergmann/libSEDML/>`__.

From there, using ``cmake-gui`` on **Windows** or ``ccmake`` on **Linux**/**macOS**, we want to:

- Customise `libSEDML <https://github.com/fbergmann/libSEDML/>`__:
  ::
    LIBSBML_INCLUDE_DIR=<libSBMLIncludeDirectory>
    LIBSBML_LIBRARY=<libSBMLLibraryFile>
    LIBZ_INCLUDE_DIR=<libSBMLDependenciesIncludeDirectory>
    WITH_CPP_NAMESPACE=ON
    WITH_SWIG=OFF
    WITH_ZLIB=ON
- Ask for a ``Release`` build (or a ``Debug`` build on **Windows** since both ``Release`` and ``Debug`` binaries are needed on that platform):
  ::
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
- Ask for C++11 compilation to be used on **Linux**/**macOS** (on **Windows**, MSVC uses C++11 by default) (this is part of the advanced settings):

  - **Linux:**
    ::
      CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-std=c++11
  - **macOS:**
    ::
      CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++

- Update the installation destination so that, upon 'installation', we have a ready to use version of the `libSEDML <https://github.com/fbergmann/libSEDML/>`__ binaries (this is particularly useful on **macOS** since the 'installation' will result in 'clean' binaries):
  ::
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<InstallationDestination>

Once we have built and 'installed' `libSEDML <https://github.com/fbergmann/libSEDML/>`__, we can replace the OpenCOR version of the include and binary files, which are located in the 'installed' ``include`` and ``lib`` folders, respectively.

**Note:** on **Linux** and **macOS**, we want to strip the binary file off its non-global symbols (using ``strip -x``)...
