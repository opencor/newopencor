We build our own copy of [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML), which requires the following:
 * [libSBML's core source code](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/); and
 * libSBML dependencies (**Windows** only; the contents of which is to be located under `[libSBML]/dependencies`):
    * [Release](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/win-dependencies/libSBML_dependencies_vs14_release_x64.zip); and
    * [Debug](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/win-dependencies/libSBML_dependencies_vs14_debug_x64.zip).

From there, using `cmake-gui` on **Windows** or `ccmake` on **Linux**/**macOS**, we want to:
 * Customise [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML):

   ```
   WITH_BZIP2=ON
   WITH_CPP_NAMESPACE=ON
   WITH_EXPAT=OFF
   WITH_LIBXML=ON
   WITH_SWIG=OFF
   WITH_XERCES=OFF
   WITH_ZLIB=ON
   ```

 * Ask for a `Release` build (or a `Debug` build on **Windows** since both `Release` and `Debug` binaries are needed on that platform):

   ```
   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   ```

 * Ask for C++11 compilation to be used on **Linux**/**macOS** (on **Windows**, MSVC uses C++11 by default) (this is part of the advanced settings):
    * **Linux:**

      ```
      CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-std=c++11
      ```

    * **macOS:**

      ```
      CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++
      ```

 * Update the installation destination so that, upon 'installation', we have a ready to use version of the [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) binaries (this is particularly useful on **macOS** since the 'installation' will result in 'clean' binaries):

   ```
   CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<InstallationDestination>
   ```

Once we have built and 'installed' [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML), we can replace the OpenCOR version of the include and binary files, which are located in the 'installed' `include` and `lib` folders, respectively.

**Note:** on **Linux** and **macOS**, we want to strip the binary file off its non-global symbols (using `strip -x`)...
