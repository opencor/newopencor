Some information on the OpenCOR logo:
 * [OpenCOR.svg](https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.svg): this was created from the original VPH logo, saving the resulting SVG file as an optimised SVG file (using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)), and beautifying the SVG file using http://xmlbeautifier.com/.
 * [splashscreen.png](https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/splashscreen.png) (as well as [[OpenCOR]/src/plugins/miscellaneous/Core/res/logo.png](https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/src/plugins/miscellaneous/Core/res/logo.png), although its size was reduced to 35%): this was created by opening [OpenCOR.svg](https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.svg) in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), reducing its size to 50%, making a screenshot, extracting the part that is inside the box, and making its background transparent (using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)).
 * [OpenCOR.pptx](https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.pptx): this was created by using a screenshot version of [OpenCOR.svg](https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.svg), adding some space around it (e.g. 50 pixels) and making sure that it is square,
 * OpenCOR[[.ico](https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.ico)|[.png](https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.png)|[.icns](https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.icns)]: these were created by saving a 100% version of [OpenCOR.pptx](https://github.com/opencor/opencor/blob/master/res/OpenCOR.pptx) as a PNG file, using that PNG file as an input to http://iconverticons.com/online/, and downloading the corresponding .ico, .png (the 256x256 pixel version) and .icns versions.
