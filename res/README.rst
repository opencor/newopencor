Some information on the OpenCOR logo:

- |OpenCOR.svg|_: this was created from the original VPH logo, saving the resulting SVG file as an optimised SVG file (using `Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`__), and beautifying it using http://xmlbeautifier.com/.
- |splashscreen.png|_ (as well as |[OpenCOR]/src/plugins/miscellaneous/Core/res/logo.png|_, although its size was reduced to 35%): this was created by opening |OpenCOR.svg|_ in `Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`__, reducing its size to 50%, making a screenshot, extracting the part that is inside the box, and making its background transparent (using `GIMP <https://www.gimp.org/>`__).
- |OpenCOR.pptx|_: this was created by using a screenshot version of |OpenCOR.svg|_, adding some space around it (e.g. ``50`` pixels), and making sure that it is square.
- ``OpenCOR``\ [\ |.ico|_\ \|\ |.png|_\ \|\ |.icns|_]: these were created by saving a 100% version of |OpenCOR.pptx|_ as a PNG file, using that PNG file as an input to http://iconverticons.com/online/, and downloading the corresponding ``.ico``, ``.png`` (the ``256x256`` pixel version) and ``.icns`` versions.
